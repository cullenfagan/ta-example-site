				<p class="intro"> <span class="location"> Bronx, New York — </span> As FEMA prepares to release new flood hazard zones and mandatory flood insurance maps in 2024, disparities in flood insurance are more visible than ever. 
				</p>
				 <p>
				Government sponsored organizations like FloodHelpNYC encourage New Yorkers to view their flood zone and find insurance based on their risk, but areas like the Bronx still have significantly less flood coverage than other boroughs.

				<p>
				While FEMA flood insurance policy information isn't available below the county level, properties in the coastal floodplain or “flood hazard” areas are more vulnerable to damage and more likely to be under a mandatory flood insurance policy. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Without flood insurance, especially in flood hazard areas, FEMA can deny flood relief in the event of large scale disasters. It also leaves communities in the lurch after smaller scale flooding that still causes expensive structural damage. 
				</p>
				<p>
				The September flooding made these vulnerabilities even more apparent in New York City, echoing recent flood events like Hurricanes Ida and Sandy. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Moustafa Metwally is the general manager of the South Bronx location of ServPro, a nationwide water damage restoration chain. In September, he saw major flood impacts in the homes of clients from outside water leaking in and sewage back ups, costing hundreds and even thousands of dollars to fix.
				</p>
				<p>
				“It's supposed to be through insurance carriers,” said Metwally. “However, within our area, unfortunately, many homeowners are underinsured. They have the bare minimum of policies that in most cases don't cover [the cost of the damage].”
				</p>
				<p>
				For some clients, ServPro was able to work out payment plans, but they were unable to do the work at all for others. Untreated, Metwally said, the damage can lead to more long term issues like mold, costing even more for repairs and risking resident health.
